                <h1>Healthcare problems: Inefficienty and Waste Causes</h1>
                <p>
                    Burocracy, resources, long queues, and abuse are common in our hospitals.
                    The healthcare industry plays a role in society's health yet it frequently
                    faces challenges with inefficiencies that result in substantial wastage.<br><br>
                    This not only incurs economic burdens but also characterizes the level of care.
                    patients receive. Here we delve into the factors contributing to waste
                    within the healthcare sector; bureaucracy, ineffective resource management,
                    lengthy wait times and delays as well, as instances of fraud and misuse.

                <h1>Excess of bureaucracy</h1>
                <p>
                    Excessive bureaucracy and inefficient handling of paperwork can lead to delays 
                    and additional costs in services provided by nursing staff. This mainly leads 
                    to an internal slowdown and consequently to a loss of time greater than the 
                    established potential loss.

                <p>
                    Implementing advanced control systems and data analysis can help identify and 
                    prevent fraud and abuse. These unfortunately do occur, albeit rarely. Here is 
                    what we thought we would propose to try to make a small change, for a better 
                    future.
